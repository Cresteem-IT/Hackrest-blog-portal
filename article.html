                <p>
                    English has two types of articles: definite and indefinite. Let’s discuss them now in more detail.
                    The definite article
                    The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing. For example, your friend
                    might ask, “Are you going to the party this weekend?” The definite article tells you that your friend is referring to a
                    specific party that both of you know about. The definite article can be used with singular, plural, or uncountable
                    nouns. Below are some examples of the definite article the used in context:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please give me the hammer and the nail.
                    The indefinite article
                    The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. It’s the
                    word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a
                    general idea rather than a particular thing. For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the
                    party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am
                    going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking
                    about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with
                    singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:
                </p>    

                <p>
                    Please hand me an autobiography; any autobiography will do.
                    Exceptions: choosing a or an
                    There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words
                    that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite
                    of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an. Consider the example sentence below for
                    an illustration of this concept.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My mother is a honest woman.
                    My mother is an honest woman.
                    Similarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound, use a, as in the sample
                    sentence below:
                    She is an United States senator.
                    She is a United States senator.
                    This holds true with acronyms and initialisms, too: an LCD display, a UK-based company, an HR department, a URL.
                    Article before an adjective
                    Sometimes an article modifies a noun that is also modified by an adjective. The usual word order is article + adjective
                    + noun. If the article is indefinite, choose a or an based on the word that immediately follows it. Consider the
                    following examples for reference:
                    Eliza will bring a small gift to Sophie’s party.
                    I heard an interesting story yesterday.
                    Indefinite articles with uncountable nouns
                    Uncountable nouns are nouns that are either difficult or impossible to count. Uncountable nouns include intangible
                    things (e.g., information, air), liquids (e.g., milk, wine), and things that are too large or numerous to count (e.g.,
                    equipment, sand, wood). Because these things can’t be counted, you should never use a or an with them—remember, the
                    indefinite article is only for singular nouns. Uncountable nouns can be modified by words like some, however. Consider
                    the examples below for reference:
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need some light in this room.
                    Using articles with pronouns
                    Possessive pronouns can help identify whether you’re talking about specific or nonspecific items. As we’ve seen,
                    articles also indicate specificity. But if you use both a possessive pronoun and an article at the same time, readers
                    will become confused. Possessive pronouns are words like his, my, our, its, her, and their. Articles should not be used
                    with pronouns. Consider the examples below.
                    Why are you reading the my book?
                    The and my should not be used together since they are both meant to modify the same noun. Instead, you should use one or
                    the other, depending on the intended meaning:
                    Why are you reading the book?
                    Why are you reading my book?
                    Omission of articles
                    Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not
                    actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.” Often, the article is omitted before nouns
                    that refer to abstract ideas. Look at the following examples:
                    Let’s go out for a dinner tonight.
                    Let’s go out for dinner tonight.
                    The creativity is a valuable quality in children.
                    Creativity is a valuable quality in children.
                    Many languages and nationalities are not preceded by an article. Consider the example below:
                </p>

                <p>
                    I studied the French in high school for four years.
                    I studied French in high school for four years.
                    Sports and academic subjects do not require articles. See the sentences below for reference:
                    I like to play the baseball.
                    I like to play baseball .
                    My sister was always good at the math .
                    My sister was always good at math .
                    Article FAQs
                    What is an article?
                    An article is a word that comes before a noun to show if it’s specific or general. Specific nouns use the article the
                    and general nouns use the article a (or an if the next word starts with a vowel sound).
                    What is an example of an article in grammar?
                    “The hammer” refers to only one hammer, but “a hammer” refers to any hammer.
                    When should we not use articles?
                    You don’t use articles with uncountable nouns or possessive pronouns. Certain nouns such as nationalities, school
                    subjects, and sports don’t need articles, especially if they refer to abstract ideas.
                    What are definite and indefinite articles?
                    Definite and indefinite articles refer to whether they describe something specific or general. “The” is the definite
                    article and “a” and “an” are indefinite articles.
